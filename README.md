A simple TodoList to teach and learn Python.

Python is a really simple programming language. It is easy to use and fun to learn and really neat to program in.
Django is a web application framework made on top of python. Django itself is also easy and fun with a lot of features
built in. Specially learning to create a small database based application like a 'todo' manager with minimum database requirements,
combination of django and python would be a great choice.
