A simple TodoList to teach and learn Python.

Python is a really simple programming language. It is easy to use and fun to learn and really neat to program in.
Django is a web application framework made on top of python. Django itself is also easy and fun with a lot of features
built in. Specially learning to create a small database based application like a 'todo' manager with minimum database requirements,
combination of django and python would be a great choice.

## Installation

**What you will need**

1. python2
2. virtualenv

**Installation process**

If virtualenv has not been created yet, create one

    $ virtualenv ~/app/djangoapp
    $ source ~/app/djangoapp/bin/activate
    (djangoapp)$ 

You should see your command line prefixed with the djangoapp like in the last line above. We now install django and the required
dependencies.

    (djangoapp)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
